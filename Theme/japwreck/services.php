                            <p>At ACR Auto, all air conditioning repair and AC services are handled by ASE-certified technicians. They have also completed training through EPA-approved AC programs. Your car is in good hands with these expert auto technicians, and they will examine your car's A/C system to see if there is a leak – and if there is, they'll stop it in their tracks before it can affect anything else.</p>
                            <p>When temperatures rise, there's nothing more refreshing than climbing into a cool, air-conditioned car. Over time, however, A/C fittings become loose, O-rings, hoses and seals wear out – and your refreshingly icy blast stops. Get the blast back with ACR Auto Complete Auto Care.</p>

A car battery supplies large amounts of electrical current for the starter, engine and other electronic accessories in the vehicle. The auto battery also recharges and stores energy from the car's alternator. Get your car battery service done at ACR Auto complete auto care, and we will make sure you have a healthy car battery.</p>
                          <p>If the engine is the heart of your vehicle, the car battery is its blood. And just like a heart can't pump without blood, an engine can't run without the juice that a car battery pumps into it. Together with the engine and the alternator, the car battery is one of the vital components of a car's health. Car battery check-ups are a must-do for your vehicle.</p>

                                <p>Picture yourself cruising down the most beautiful road in the world. Now imagine driving down that same road with your wheels pointing the wrong way. Not the most beautiful road in the world anymore. Alignment is a really complex topic covering a variety of terms and a smorgasbord of parts. </p>

                                <p>Bad roads can be your wheels’ worst enemy. If you drive down poorly maintained roads, drive through pot holes, or even hit a curb, your alignment can be greatly affected. This can cause even the slightest, tiniest alignment issue, which can accelerate uneven tire wear. Make sure you have your alignment checked every 6,000 miles.</p>

                                <p>Camber plays a major role in your cornering and stability. Now, to give you a demonstration, you’re going to want to use your feet to best understand camber. Let’s get started. Stand up. No, really, stand up. Now, place all your weight on the outside of both feet. This is what is called 'positive camber.'</p>

                                <p>Thrust, and its respective thrust angle, all relate to the positioning angles for your back tires. The thrust angle is the degree in which the back tires try to steer the front of the vehicle and is a major factor in your car’s ability to keep you cruising along a straight path. The more the thrust angle is off, the more the rear of the car will steer the front.</p>
